 Entity->Repository->Service->ServiceImpl->Controller(API endpoints)

 @Autowired is a Spring annotation that automatically injects dependencies into a class.
  It tells Spring: “Please give me an instance of this class so I can use it.

 Controller -> The controller handles HTTP requests (like GET, POST).
               Controller methods call service methods

   Why @VehicleService?: It delegates business logic to the service layer. You don’t want to write logic in the controller.
   Why @Autowired?: Spring injects the  service implementation so the controller can use its methods.


  ServieImpl ->The service layer contains business logic.
  Why @VehicleRepository?: It interacts with the database using JPA.
  Why @Autowired?: Spring injects the repository so the service can perform DB operations like save(),findAll().
